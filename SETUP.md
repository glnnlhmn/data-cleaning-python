# Setup Guide for Data Cleaning Using Python

Welcome to the Data Cleaning Using Python repository! This guide will help you get started with the examples provided in this repository.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- pip (Python package installer)

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/glnnlhmn/data-cleaning-python.git
   cd data-cleaning-python
   ```

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment**:

   Creating a virtual environment helps to manage dependencies and avoid conflicts with other projects.

   - **On Windows**:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - **On macOS and Linux**:
     ```bash
     python3 -m venv venv
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

   You should see the name of the virtual environment (e.g., `(venv)`) in your terminal prompt, indicating that the virtual environment is active.


3. **Install Dependencies**:

   Install the required Python packages using the `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run Jupyter Notebook**:

   Start Jupyter Notebook to explore the examples:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

5. **Open the Example Notebooks**:

   Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory and open a notebook to get started with an example.
